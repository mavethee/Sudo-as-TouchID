# sudo as Touch ID
 Simple Bash Script to add Touch ID as a sudo command verification method. 

 This gets replaced with every update because AppleTM, so update macOS? RE-RUN BRUH!

 ### Requirements:

 - A working Mac with Touch ID, no pun intended, I like Hacks but **bro, no**

 - A working brain, I hope.

 ### Usage:

 - [Download](sudo_TouchID.sh), double click and run. 
 
**Needs your super secret password sadly, what a bummer.**
