# sudo with Touch ID Authentication

This is the cringest README I've ever done, but

Inject some rawr-worthy energy into your macOS world with this edgy Bash Script that empowers your inner hacker by unleashing Touch ID as a sudo command verification method. 

**RawrXD Note**: This script is your rebel companion, perfectly harmonizing with macOS 14 (Sonoma) and beyond. ðŸ¤˜ <br>
But if you're still dwelling in the past with macOS Ventura (13) or older, brace yourself for potential script re-runs after updates.<br> 
Stay wild! ðŸ–¤

### Dark Requirements:

- A Mac with Touch ID support (because your Mac needs to be as edgy as you are!)

- An active, brooding brain, but don't sweat it; we won't be throwing any mainstream questions your way.

- macOS Sonoma, so you can join the underground elite. ðŸŒ‘

### How to Join the Dark Side:

1. [Download the script](sudo_TouchID.sh).

2. Double-click like a true rebel.

3. Get ready for the mind-blowing Touch ID authentication experience! Rawr xD ðŸ¦‡ðŸ’€

**Warning**: Your super-secret password is still needed for security reasons. We may be rebels, but we're responsible rebels. Stay safe! ðŸ”’
